# Visual requests — what needs a design before it is built

**Status: tree — requests, each in the shape Claude Design needs.** The
sixth of the six lists (`PROGRAM-PLAN.md` §2.6, D352), and the rule it
serves, from `CLAUDE.md`: **visuals are designed in Claude Design before
they are built.** A new screen, module, lens, card family, overlay or
visual language is a request here first; a control added to a surface
that already exists — a button, a toggle, a row — is not, and needs no
request. `VISUAL-VISION.md` names the design the tree is built toward.

## The shape of a request

Written so Claude Design understands it whole, without the routine in
the room:

- **title · asked by** — the lane and run, or the owner.
- **surface** — tab · stop · lens, and what is around it.
- **data and basis** — which aggregates or published documents it
  draws, which floors, what D1's empty state shows.
- **states** — empty · loading · live · demo.
- **interaction** — what a tap, a drag, a long press does.
- **vocabulary** — what it must fit: the standalone family in
  `design/`, `src/v2/styles.css`, the two palettes of D302, the copy
  rule D182 (*visual > word > sentence > sentences*).
- **constraints** — the bundle ceiling (`check:bundle`), first paint,
  reads per open, tap targets (`check:tap-targets`).
- **why** — the theory node or axiom that asked for it.
- **status** — `requested` → `planned` (the plan written in full by
  the routine that will draft) → `drafted` (the canvas published with
  the design skill; its link on the row — the owner refines it) →
  `designed` (the owner's canvas accepted, extracted under `design/`)
  → `built` (PR) → crossed out, and `VISUAL-VISION.md` moves.

The owner's rule for the drafting step (2026-09-02): *a routine can
draft it as long as it first makes the plan, then uses Claude Design.*

## Requested

### 1 · Trait-axis directions on the patterns Map

- **asked by** — the program plan, 2026-09-02, ahead of the axes
  build lane reaching step 1.4; the theory it serves is AXES-PLAN §2.
- **surface** — the **patterns** tab, Map lens: the constellation of
  core questions placed by how much each answer predicts the others
  (D215's shapes, `design/standalone-2026-08-20/`). The directions are
  drawn *in* that plane, not on a new screen.
- **data and basis** — the `axes:` block the nightly fit would
  publish beside the `q:` rows of `v2_patterns/loadings` (AXES-RUNBOOK
  1.1–1.2): per trait axis a direction vector in the same K-space, its
  `n`, its fit quality. An absent block draws nothing (D1); a
  per-column fit-quality floor takes an axis back off the map (1.5).
- **states** — no block: the Map as today; block present: labelled
  directions ("Openness points this way; these questions lean with
  it"), each with its basis reachable; demo: never, the block is live
  only.
- **interaction** — tap an axis label: the questions leaning with it
  light, the rest recede; tap again to release; the bottom card states
  the basis in words the way the tie panel does ("drawn from the
  crowd's latest answers").
- **vocabulary** — `ui/PatternsMap.tsx`, `ui/patterns.css`, the 08-26
  polish (labels centred by grid row, the `.or-cap` one-line key).
- **constraints** — zero extra reads (the block rides the loadings
  document already fetched); labels must not collide with the
  declutter pass; 44 px tap targets on the labels.
- **why** — *"the axes exist to be connected"* (charter §1); AXES-PLAN
  §2: "That is the owner's sentence, drawn, on data that publishes
  today."
- **note (2026-09-02)** — the vision moved to the 2026-09-02 standalone,
  whose Map is a **ring**: questions on a rim grouped by topic, ties as
  chords, position no longer a claim about similarity
  (`VISUAL-VISION.md`; `VISION-2026-09-02.md` §1.2). The plane this
  request draws its directions *in* is retired with it. The plan step
  re-aims the request against the ring — an axis as a band on the rim,
  or a family of chords that lean with it — before anything is drafted;
  the data, the states and the basis rule above stand.
- **status** — `requested`.

### 2 · The corner doors for earned axes

- **asked by** — the program plan, 2026-09-02; the theory is
  AXES-PLAN §5, whose own step 3 says *prototype the grammar in the
  standalone first*.
- **surface** — the shell: the two free corners beside the centred tab
  pill (`.tabbar` / `.tab-group`), inside the safe-area inset.
- **data and basis** — a door reads one gate signal through `LIVE`
  (the `patternsReady` shape, D265): consent given, enough of you,
  enough of the crowd; remembered, purge-closed.
- **states** — below the gate: *nothing* — no button, no teaser, no
  "coming soon" (D265, verbatim shape); crossed: the corner appears for
  that account and stays; demo: never.
- **interaction** — a tap asks the shell to navigate (`NAV.goNav`,
  a request with spring-back), the same grammar the daily ruler's
  near-end exit uses.
- **vocabulary** — the corner chrome the Map canvas already speaks
  (`.mmt-zoomctl`); the two-palette rule of D302.
- **constraints** — 44 px (`check:tap-targets`), the native safe-area
  inset, no new eager bytes.
- **why** — the owner's instinct that *connections radiate in every
  direction*, made honest: a corner means "this account carries a
  further axis".
- **status** — `requested`; waits on an axis earning it (AXES-RUNBOOK
  5.2) before it is built, but the design can be drafted any time.

### 3 · The fit scorecard's reader

- **asked by** — the axes retro (run log #290, the highest-leverage
  item in the queue) and the map theory lane's request that crossed at
  D325; on the worklist as an `[ask]`, because the shape is a design
  question before it is code.
- **surface** — open: either an operator page (the pulse console's
  family, `monitoring/pulse.html`) or the patterns tab's Oracle
  "working" card. The design decides; the request is what it must
  show.
- **data and basis** — what the nightly fit publishes on
  `v2_patterns/loadings` since D325: the prequential benchmark (a
  pooled, per-question-floored daily log-loss series — the fit's
  predictive power, not the Oracle's) and the inter-fit displacement
  (loading-space and drawn-plane, reported as two numbers).
- **states** — no history yet (the fit is young): the series as a
  short line with its basis; a per-question floor withholding a cell:
  drawn as withheld, never as zero.
- **interaction** — a question tapped on the Map shows its own series;
  the operator page shows the pooled one with the displacement beside
  it.
- **vocabulary** — the pulse console's panel grammar if operator-side;
  the 08-26 Oracle working card if user-side.
- **constraints** — reads nothing new; the document is fetched already.
- **why** — unlocks the `measured` rung for three theory lanes at once
  (map-3, pat-5, pat-6; the 2026-09-01 digest, bridge item 2).
- **status** — `requested`.
